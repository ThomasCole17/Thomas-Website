 I am from a city in England called Portsmouth. It is a  <strong> really </strong> nice place to stay because I think the weather is really nice.
          You can also ride a daily ferry to the Isle Of Wight. It's a really short journey that takes about 40 mins. Youy can take really nice walks along the seaside.
 There is also a place where you can get a lovely hot chocolate in a place called the <em>Tenth Hole Tea Rooms. </em> </p>
          <p> The main reason why it is called the Tenth Hole is because it is built next to a golf course that has 9 holes. So after you play golf, you will visit the last hole (the tenth one). </p>

          There is a wide selection of delicious cakes and desserts each one being equally fantastic.</p>
