            <p style="font-family:verdana"> I am from a city in England called Portsmouth. It is a <strong> really </strong> nice place to stay because I think the weather is really nice.
              You can also catch a daily ferry to the Isle Of Wight. It's a really short journey that takes about 40 mins. Youy can take really nice walks along the seaside.
              <br>
              Later in this article, I will talk about my favourite cafe, the local football team, the best walking destination and sightseeing.

              <p style="font-family:verdana"> The main reason why it is called the Tenth Hole is because it is built next to a golf course that has 9 holes. So after you play golf, you will visit the final, tenth hole.
                There is a wide selection of delicious cakes and desserts each one being equally fantastic. https://www.thetenthhole.co.uk/ Here is a link to the website of this cafe!
